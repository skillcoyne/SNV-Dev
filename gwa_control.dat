Notes:
(1) The input files will be accessed through
        PhasedDataPathPrefix#PhasedDataPathAffix
    The # is a single digit for chr 1-9 and two digits for chr 10-23.

(2) If the simulated data are not output to files, the program should
    be incorporate into an analysis program so that the simulation to
    analysis is on the fly.

    If the data are output to files, options are:
    (2a) linkage:  each row is a person, with pedid, indid, fid, mid,
    sex (1=male, 2=female), status (0=unknown, 1=unaffected, 2=affected),
    followed by SNP alleles ("1"=allele 0, "2"=allele 1, two alleles
    per SNP)
    (2b) genotype:  each row is a person and each column is a SNP, with
    genotype 0, 1, 2 (#copies of allele 1)
    (2c) phased:  a person has two rows, each being a chromosome

(3) WINDOW_SIZE is the size of moving window in data generation.  The
    haplotype at WINDOW_SIZE-1 SNPs is used to simulate the next SNP allele.

(4) If NUMDL=0, then population samples are simulated, with Ncontf
    females and Ncontm males.

(5) Region and start and end positions:

    If NUMDL>0 and Region=1, then start and end position information
    is required for all disease locus.

    If NUMDL>0 and Region=0, then start and end position information
    is not required and is ignored if present.

    If NUMDL=0 (i.e., population sampling), then the region option is
    not required and is ignored if present.  [To do regional
    simulations under population sampling, one can create a disease
    model with all GRRs=1.]

(6) Disease locus position is the position in the phased input file,
    not the physical position on a chromosome.  For example,
    DL1pos=2885 means the 2885th SNP of the input file is diseaes
    locus 1.

    The current version of the program allows one disease variant per
    chromosome.

    DV is the disease variant (risk allele).

    GRR is the genotypic relative risk of the genotype with one copy
    of the risk allele versus that with zero copy of the risk allele.

    GRR2 is the genotypic relative risk of the genotype with two copies
    of the risk allele versus that with zero copy of the risk allele.
    If the valus is "M" (without quotes), then multiplicative effect
    is assumed and GRR2 is calculated as GRR*GRR.
    If the valus is "D" (without quotes), then dominance effect is
    assumed and GRR2 is calculated as GRR.
    For recessive effect, specify 1.0 for GRR and a value >1 for GRR2.

    Start and end positions are required for regional case-control
    simulations.  They are not required and will be ignored for
    genomic case-control simulations and population sampling.  The
    start and end positions are positions in the phased input file,
    not the physical position on a chromosome.

(7) The program continues to read until a blank line.  Each line
    starting with "Inter2" will be treated as information on
    interaction effects, with two numbers for disease loci and four
    numbers for departure from product multiplicative relative risks.
    See the manual for details.
